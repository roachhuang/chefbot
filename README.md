1. hub.launch
2. pc or pi.launch
3. heavy_load.launch

rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py

the ~ (tilde) at the beginning of the parameter name indicates that this is a private name specic to one node. Perhaps the easiest way to assign such a parameter is to include it between the node tags in a launch

1. unplug arduino and lidar cables
2. power on pi4
3. ssh pi4 (to make sure pi4 is on)
4. connect arduino cable and trun on the motor power
5. launch hub.launch and echo lwheel topic on pc to make sure hub working
6. launch pi.launch 
7. launch heavy_load from pc to test motors

8. // Navigation // 
9. kill heavy_load session
10. connect lidar cable to pi4 (make sure it starts to spin)
11. launch lidar from pi4
12. launch nav from pc

rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py

python3 -m pip install pyserial
sudo adduser your_username dialout


to do:
    substitute messenger with serial.event
    pi is operating at 3.3v. ardunio like due and teensy also use 3.3v so no voltage level-shifter is required.
    sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
    

    pub battery info
    Use 2 ’s complement arithmetic to subtract previous from current readings to obtain position increment.
    dynamic mpu claibration
    check out joint limit
    calibrate motor ticks and camera
    connect imu's ad0 to ground so it address will be fixed at 0x68
    udev rules for fixing ttyusbX for a usb device
        0. Udev stores all the rules in the /etc/udev/rules.d/ 
        1. connect a device to a usb port, dmesg|grep 
        2. udevadm info -a -p  $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/ttyUSB0) |grep serial
        3. look for serial and product
        4. ACTION=="add", ATTRS{product}=="<product>", ATTRS{serial}=="<serial>", SYMLINK+="arduion"
        5. uplug your devce and re-plug it in, and check the /dev/arduino

    do i need to broadcast imu?

    debgging:
        why robot won't move?
            1. check /etc/ttyUSB0 & 1
            2. echo imu/data to see if it is published
            3. measure the voltage of batteries output
